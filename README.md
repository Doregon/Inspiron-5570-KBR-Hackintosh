# Inspiron-5570-KBR-Hackintosh
Use this if you have the i7-8550U variant of the Inspiron 5570. This EFI works with Big Sur 11.0 to Monterey 12.0 developer beta 2!

Everything works, credit to phd91105 for the most part with ACPI patches and kexts, just adjusted for this particular model.

Bootloader: Opencore 0.7.0

Kexts: all updated

# What works?

| Function | Works? | Extra comments |
|-----------|--------| ---------------|
| GPU acceleration | Yes | Even though the framebuffer is not recommended, this one performs better. |
| Intel WiFi | Yes | | 
| Intel Bluetooth| Yes | May have problems with any headset connected. A fix is to disable WiFi. |
| Realtek Ethernet | Yes | |

| NVRAM | Yes | Emulated |
| iServices | Yes | The serial numbers that are here don't work, you have to make your own. |
| DRM | No | Fairplay does not work properly on the iGPU-only model. Stream with Chrome or download your iTunes movies first. |

| USB ports | Yes | |
| Fingerprint sensor | No | Fingerprint sensors require the T2 chip. |


I'm working on fixing anything that doesn't work properly. Here's my to-do:

* Fix sleeping problems
* Potentially emulate the T2 chip for fingerprint sensors (?)

# Recommended SMBIOS

Use the MacBookPro16,3 SMBIOS for this model. If you experience the "MacBookPro16," problem, make sure that the CustomSMBIOSGUID quirk is enabled and the SMBIOS update method is set to Custom (this EFI in this repo provide this already).

# Note about the EFI

This EFI is provided to work without any problems, all you need to do is change the SMBIOS variables and you'll be all set with a perfectly tolerable Hackintosh. If, for any reason, something doesn't work properly, you should open an issue on this repo and detail what's wrong.
